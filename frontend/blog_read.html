                        <p>
                            Our journeys into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are unique, and
                            the reasons we embark on this path can vary. However you may have decided to pursue
                            technology, it’s easy to feel discouraged by the underrepresentation of women in the field.
                            While this may pose a challenge, it does not define your limits or your potential. In this
                            article, we’ll explore how to navigate these feelings and build confidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout your journey, you have likely encountered various successes, no matter how small
                            they may seem. Start embracing and celebrating them. Even something as simple as debugging a
                            piece of code or solving a technological issue can be a small win. Collecting these small
                            victories and reminding yourself of them will help you feel more capable and strengthen your
                            passion to succeed in this field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you’re new to this field, unsure where to begin, or experiencing doubts, find
                            transferable skills. Whether you’re a student with little experience or someone
                            transitioning from a different career, you’re likely to already have skills that will
                            benefit you in the field of technology. Are you detail-oriented? A great problem-solver?
                            Passionate about learning and growth? All these qualities are valuable in technology. You
                            have the toolkit to get started.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Building confidence requires reframing limiting beliefs. Once you can recognise your
                            capabilities and start celebrating your progress, your path will light up, even if it is in
                            small steps. This will inevitably lead to larger successes. It takes resilience and
                            patience, but you have the power to succeed.

                            “Your self-worth is determined by you. You don’t have to depend on someone telling you who
                            you are.” – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Author.

                            Technology is a constantly evolving field, meaning learning is non-stop. If you enjoy
                            learning, and thrive in environments with constant change, this field will suit you. It’s
                            important to also invest in growing your expertise. Take additional certifications, attend
                            courses or read literature related to your field. These efforts will contribute to your
                            ongoing development.

                        <p>
                            If possible, find a mentor – someone who can directly teach you and guide your growth. If
                            you admire someone in the field, look for opportunities to learn from them. Female mentors
                            can particularly offer unique perspectives and insight. Investing time in expanding your
                            knowledge will open many doors for you and affirm that you have the knowledge needed to
                            succeed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Building confidence takes time but remember that you already have everything you need to
                            succeed. Reframe your thoughts, acknowledge your achievements, and continue to engage in
                            lifelong learning. Over time, the confidence you build will shine through, and others will
                            see your potential as well. The technology world needs your perspective and voice, never
                            underestimate the impact you can make.
